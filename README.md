Key features:
Analyze 2–5 players across recent games.
Get detailed win/loss statistics and performance breakdowns.
Filter results by game mode (e.g. ARAM, Ranked Flex).
Simple, intuitive UI for both casual and competitive players.
RuevGG uses the official Riot Games APIs (match, summoner, and champion) to ensure accurate and up-to-date stats.
